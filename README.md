# PatternCombination
Assignmnet

The 2 creational patterns used in this project are: Singleton and builder.
Singleton pattetn is used in order to have only instance of the database connetion used throughout the whole project.
Builder pattern is used to create objets in a systematic way. Since it has a few parameters and passing all of them could make things wronng if sometime in future the legacy country class is altered.Therefore having a builder pattern removes this concern of passing parameters at a wrong place and it is easier to read and understand.
