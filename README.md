# PatternCombination
Assignmnet

The 2 creational patterns used in this project are: Singleton and builder.
Singleton pattern is used in order to have only one instance of the database connetion used throughout the whole project.
Builder pattern is used to create objets in a systematic way. Since it has a few parameters and passing all of them could make things wronng if in future the legacy country class is altered.Therefore having a builder pattern removes this concern of passing parameters at a wrong place and it is easier to read and understand.
